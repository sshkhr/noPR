## How It Works

- üîç Adds a dropdown filter button to GitHub issues pages
- üü¢ Easily find issues with linked pull requests
- üî¥ Quickly identify issues without linked pull requests
- üîÑ Works with GitHub's modern SPA navigation
- üé® Seamlessly matches GitHub's design in both light and dark modes

The extension adds a visually distinctive red and green icon to GitHub's issue toolbar. Clicking it reveals a dropdown with three options:

1. **No Filter**: Show all issues (default)
2. **Issues with Linked PR**: Show only issues that have associated pull requests
3. **Issues w/o Linked PR**: Show only issues that don't have associated pull requests

The filter works by adding `linked:pr` or `-linked:pr` to GitHub's search query, making use of GitHub's built-in search functionality.

## Usage

1. Navigate to any GitHub repository's issues page
2. Look for the red and green pull request icon in the toolbar
3. Click it to show the dropdown menu
4. Select one of the three filtering options
